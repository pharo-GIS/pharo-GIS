## Standards and organisation

* The [Open Geospatial Consortium](https://www.ogc.org/) (OGC), an international voluntary consensus standards organization. You can find a lot of specifications on their website
  * [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) (officially Simple Feature Access) is both an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard ISO 19125 that specifies a common storage and access model of mostly two-dimensional geometries (point, line, polygon, multi-point, multi-line, etc.). We can find the spec [here](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sfa).
* The [Open Source Geospatial Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/) (OSGeo), is a non-profit non-governmental organization whose mission is to support and promote the collaborative development of open geospatial technologies and data. it proposes to put users and developers in touch with each other

## Software

* [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) is a computer software library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats. This library provides very powerful tools to change projection systems. It is used by a very [large number of software](https://gdal.org/software_using_gdal.html#software-using-gdal) and in particular [Google Map](https://thenewstack.io/gdal-the-open-source-technology-behind-google-maps/)
